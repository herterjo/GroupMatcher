# GroupMatcher
A group matcher to match members and leaders to groups according to their preferences.
First argument is path to input json file. If ommited "input.json" is used.

"Frontend" contains a simple website which makes the creating of the input file much easier 
(but the result still has to be executed by the main GroupMatcher program, and is currently only available in German)
